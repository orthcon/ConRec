# Connection-Coefficients
Compute the connection coefficients of orthogonal polynomials

The package APCI is required to support the computations.
More precisely, we need the Ext_Zeil and qExt_Zeil of APCI.

The main file is conrec.mpl and the example file is examples.mw which
includes all the examples in the manuscript.

To use the package, one need the following steps.

1. Download the files APCI.
To make the package work, one needs firstly install the APCI package.
