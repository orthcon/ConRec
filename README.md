# Connection-Coefficients
Compute the connection coefficients of orthogonal polynomials

The package APCI is required to support the computations.
More precisely, we need the Ext_Zeil and qExt_Zeil of APCI.

The main file is conrec.mpl and the example file is examples.mw which
includes all the examples in the manuscript.
